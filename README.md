<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Skripter is a desktop application that performs following functions: 
  - Records video
  - Converts the video into important slides
  - Converts audio into transcripts
  - Summarizes the transcripts
  - Compiles the summary and important slides
  - Converts the compiled information into smart notes with time stamps.

In essence, the app is designed to help users efficiently process and condense video content into more manageable and organized notes. The use of time stamps in the final output, "smart notes," further supports this goal by tying specific information to specific moments in the original video.

# Problem Statement - Online Notes Maker
An online class is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system over platform which support audio video streaming. You are required to create a desktop app which can run over any online multimedia platform such as google meet. The app should produce a ppt of the slides shown by the teacher at the end of class. Apart from ppt the app should also produce a text file which will be made up of words spoken by the teacher and students during the class.
